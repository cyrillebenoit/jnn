#JNN - Java Neural Network

Hello! jnn is a neural network library for Java to make neural networks available to everyone, educators and beginners.

The library currently only supports fully-connected multilayer perceptron network, with stochastic gradient descent. More machine learning algorithms will be added throughout the development of the library.

## Dependancies
The library only depends on [jblas](http://jblas.org) for linear algebra.
